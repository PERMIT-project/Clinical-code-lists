# Clinical-code-lists

The following clinical code lists currently remain under development. Each provides two columns of codes with descriptions. 

Medcodes includes clinical codes proprietary to CPRD, updated as of May 2018. 

The ReadCodes column contains a list of EMIS, OXMIS and ReadCodes V2 identified as present within the SIR extract analysed in this study. It may therefore not be exhaustive for use in other systems. 

Please be aware that hierachical representatons of Read Codes can vary across EHR systems- for example, creatinine code 44J3 can be written as "44J3", "44J3." or "44J3.00" interchangeably, therefore all potential suffixes should be considered or adjusted for within processing codes.

In some instances where there is no medcode equivalent available to match to a Read/EMIS/OXMIS code, a higher level medcode is provided in the medcode column. If using medcodes for phenotypic differentiation then medcodes must therefore be cross-references to the CPRD-Gold data dictionary for confirmation of specific meaning.

Full code dictionaries can be obtained from NHS Digital and CPRD.

The following abbreviations are used in file names and in places in final output tables:

BMI: Body mass index
BNP: Blood naturietic protein
BUN: Blood urea nitrogen
DBP: Diastolic blood pressure
IHD: Ischaemic heart disease
NTPROBNP: NT-pro-BNP
RM: Renal malignancy
SBP: Systolic blood pressure
UAlbumin: Urine albumin
UACR: Urine albumin to creatinine ratio
