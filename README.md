# Clinical-code-lists

The following clinical code lists provide two columns. 

Medcodes includes clinical codes proprietary to CPRD, updated as of May 2018. 

The ReadCodes column contains a list of EMIS, OXMIS and ReadCodes V2 identified as present within the SIR extract analysed in this study. It may therefore not be exhaustive for use in other systems. 

Please be aware that hierachical representatons of Read Codes can vary across EHR systems- for example, creatinine code 44J3 can be written as "44J3", "44J3." or "44J3.00" interchangeably, therefore all potential suffixes should be considered or adjusted for within processing codes.

Full code dictionaries can be obtained from NHS Digital and CPRD.
